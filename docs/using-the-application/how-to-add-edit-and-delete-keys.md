# How to add, edit and delete keys?

Navigate to your chosen namespace in your project. Here you can directly edit the values or delete the keys by clicking "delete segment" on the segment item menu. To add a new key select "Add key" in the menu.

*Keep in mind: You can add keys only in your reference language!*
